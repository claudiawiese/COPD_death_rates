### Description of the project
The aim of the following project is to calculate the the crude and the age standardized chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) death rates in both the United States and Uganda in 2019.

The crude death rate (CDR) is a demographic measure that represents the number of deaths occurring in a given population over a specific period, usually per 1,000 or 100,000 individuals.

The CDR is calculated as followed

CDR = (Number of death / Population) * multiplier

We will work with the multiplier 100000

To calculate the overall age standardized crude death rate we will apply average standardized population rates from 2000 to 2025.
